                        My introduction into the world of web development and hacking began in the mid 90's, when dial up modems were all the rage.
                        Back then Yahoo! had the 'choicest' search engine on the net and the best way to build a simple website was on GeoCities.com. 
                        In my teens, I became enthralled by the art of hacking, portrayed by Holloywood and the mainstream media as something akin to  
                        forbidden magic (perfect for a rebellious teenager from the suburbs). Alas, the mythos alone wasn't 
                        enough to keep me focused on learning the technical skills I needed to become a hacker, let alone build a simple computer program. 
                        I quickly realized that working with the technical side of computers required a specific mind-set and proficiency that could only be acquired through hard 
                        work and a lot of trial and error. It wasn't until 2019 that I would fully commit myself to learning how 
                        computers and the internet really worked.

                        Following my gradution from the Web Development bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs in 2019, I took a free course on cyber
                        security with a particular focus on something called Penetration Testing (it's not what you think...). Cyber Security experts
                        who practice this disicpline (often referred to as Pen Testers) are employed by companies who take digital security seriously. 
                        Pen testers are paid to break into their client's computer systems, teach them how they got in and how to 
                        prevent other people from doing it in the future. This industry is only growing and becoming more vital as people from around 
                        the world continue to transfer their businesses and personal data to online platforms.

                    <p>
                        After my brief foray into the world of Pen Testing I watched a particularly scary documentary called 'The Great Hack', which 
                        highlighted the incredible amount of influence government parties and companies, like the now defunct Cambridge Analytica, can 
                        exercise over the general public. They have the ability to collect and analzye huge amounts of data about the personal habits, 
                        beliefs and behaviours of people from every walk of life for whatever purpose they deem appropriate. To top it off, they can build
                        remarkably accurate psychological profiles based on this data and use them to influence people and ultimately direct their behaviour.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vision's of Orwell's 1984 quickly swirled through my head after watching this film and I decided to dig into the technical capabilities 
                        behind some of these companies. It didn't take long for me to realize that collecting data about users is absurdly 
                        easy and making simple connections about their personal preferences, likes, dislikes, beliefs and even their secrect desires is not 
                        a monumental task. On the contrary it is the future for every company who wants to acquire more cusomters and any politician who wants to win
                        more votes. The truth is that advertising and influence is becoming more targeted and more effective on a larger scale than ever before.

                        In 2020, most people who use the internet in their daily lives understand that their personal data is always being collected and
                        analyzed for one reason or another. But do they know <storng>how</storng> that data is captured? Do they understand what this data 
                        <strong>can</strong> be used for? Perhaps most importantly, do they know how to protect themselves against entities who do not have
                        their best interests at heart? I asked a few friends and family members these questions and found that most people didn't really 
                        understand the extent to which their data is collected, analyzed and often sold. They also had very little idea about how to protect 
                        themselves against this kind of data collection.

                        After enough of these conversations I decided to put my new development skills to good use. Browser Power was born from the basic desire to educate
                        people about one of the many ways applications collect personal data from their users.
                        If people don't understand how their data is collected, they have little chance of making informed decisions about how 
                        to protect themselves. Hopefully, this project will enhance someone's ability to have a more informed discussion about data 
                        privacy with a colleague at work, a family member or even with a politician voting on a digital security bill. 
                        
                        When you open an app or navigate 
                        to a website ask yourself: 'What kind of data is being collected, how might it be used and am I comfortable with this entity getting access to my information?'.
